In the subject area 

====

In the field of lighting and stage technology, the challenge of controlling the individual installations, called 'fixtures', quickly and without complications is a recurring one. 
Established solutions are realized via cables.

\section{Motivation/Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Reliability
	\item .. and why 100\% Reliability is not important (except pyrotechnics)
	\item Lower latency
	\item Synchronisation
	\item higher update frequency
	\item Range
\end{itemize}

\section{Challenges}
