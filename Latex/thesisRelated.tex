% \section{References}

% What follows is just a very quick refresher on how to use references.
% It is not a guide on scientific writing in general, nor copyright and plagiarism in particular.
% Please refer to an actual guide on technical writing and scientific practices to make sure you understand how, where, and when to cite.

% Simply speaking, proper scientific writing has to deal with two closely related (but not identical) concepts:
% \begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*),ref=(\alph*)]
% \item\label{itm:ref:copy}
% Copyright
% \item
% Plagiarism\label{itm:ref:plag}
% \end{enumerate}
% Do not confuse the need for properly citing your sources as something related to copyright.
% Questions of~\ref{itm:ref:copy} copyright or the corresponding national equivalent deal with who has the right to reproduce a certain text excerpt, an image, or something similar.
% Questions of~\ref{itm:ref:plag} plagiarism deal with who came up with a certain idea or insight, e.g., a certain finding, a certain concept, or a certain way of illustrating a concept.
% By way of analogy, consider a car: after buying a car you have the right to~\ref{itm:ref:copy} do whatever you want with it, but you still cannot claim that you~\ref{itm:ref:plag} invented it.
% Conversely, properly~\ref{itm:ref:plag} crediting who invented your neighbor's car does not give you the right to~\ref{itm:ref:copy} use it.
% Put yet another way, problem~\ref{itm:ref:copy} is a legal one: to be allowed to publish a scientific work you (or, rather, your publisher) needs to have permission to reproduce it -- or suffer legal consequences like heavy fines.
% Problem~\ref{itm:ref:plag} is an academic one: claiming someone else's ideas as one's own is plagiarism; similarly, re-selling old ideas as new ones is self-plagiarism.
% Both incur heavy penalties like exclusion from schools and professional associations or being blacklisted from publishing with scientific outlets for any number of years.

% You will need to address both problems in writing your thesis.
% Problem~\ref{itm:ref:copy} can be addressed in two ways:
% First, by creating original content (that is, text or figures) yourself, which is always preferable as this gives you the freedom to present the content your way.
% Second, by obtaining a license to reproduce content (e.g., by way of buying a license or adhering to the terms of an existing copyleft license).
% Problem~\ref{itm:ref:plag} can be addressed in two ways:
% First, presenting original ideas and insights (as you will do when presenting own results).
% Second, by clearly pointing out the (primary) source of an idea.
% The latter is the topic of this section.

% In brief, use references whenever you cite from related work (either directly or indirectly), or when you build on related work (this includes their way of illustrating a particular concepts, in text form as well as in the overall design of a figure).
% Also use references to point a reader to related work.
% Clearly distinguish between these uses.
% Make it very clear which part of a statement a reference belongs to.
% Compare the following three, vastly different uses (where the cited idea appears in \textbf{boldface}):

% \begin{itemize}
% \item ``\textbf{Foo and bar are of equal value. Thus, any can be used.}''~\cite{akyildiz2002survey,arampatzis2005survey}
% \item According to~\cite{akyildiz2002survey} and~\cite{arampatzis2005survey}, \textbf{foo and bar are of equal value, and any can be used}.
% \end{itemize}
% versus
% \begin{itemize}
% \item ``\textbf{Foo and bar are of equal value}''~\cite{akyildiz2002survey,arampatzis2005survey}. Thus, any can be used.
% \item According to~\cite{akyildiz2002survey} and~\cite{arampatzis2005survey}, \textbf{foo and bar are of equal value}. From this it follows that any can be used.
% \end{itemize}
% versus
% \begin{itemize}
% \item Foo and \textbf{bar}~\cite{akyildiz2002survey,arampatzis2005survey} are of equal value. Thus, any can be used.
% \item Foo and \textbf{bar} (detailed in~\cite{akyildiz2002survey} and~\cite{arampatzis2005survey}) are of equal value. Thus, any can be used.
% \end{itemize}
% versus
% \begin{itemize}
% \item \textbf{Foo}~\cite{akyildiz2002survey} and \textbf{bar}~\cite{arampatzis2005survey} are of equal value. Thus, any can be used.
% \item \textbf{Foo} (detailed in~\cite{akyildiz2002survey}) and \textbf{bar} (detailed in~\cite{arampatzis2005survey}) are of equal value. Thus, any can be used.
% \end{itemize}

% Never typeset a reference after the final full stop of a paragraph (or sentence) and expect your reader to figure out which part of the paragraph is an indirect citation and which part is original (i.e., your own) work.
% When paraphrasing longer passages of text, use an indirect citation.
% Make sure to clearly point out when you are finished paraphrasing, like so:
% \emph{According to \textcite{akyildiz2002survey}, Foo and Bar can be characterized as follows. They are big. They are bright. The authors further argue that one can be substituted for the other. In the following I will go on to prove that this is not true.}

% When citing more than a few pages worth of text, point the reader to the specific part you are referring to in your citation, like so:
% \emph{In recent years, an increasing number of cyclists are switching from air filled tires to cement filled ones~\cite[Table IV]{dietrich2009lifetime}}.

% If a figure or a table is closely based on another one, make sure to cite its source, preferably in its caption, like so:
% \emph{Figure 1 -- the relation of ravens and writing desks (based on~\cite[Figure~42]{dietrich2009lifetime})}.
% Be aware that, while there is a well-established convention on how to illustrate a verbatim quote of text (by using quotation marks), there is no well-established convention for indicating that an image was copied verbatim.
% Thus, when citing a figure or table, you must explicitly state whether it was copied verbatim, ed, or whether it served as inspiration for your own.

% Do not cite URLs. Content found there is not peer reviewed and it is likely to change during the lifetime of your work.
% For pointing a reader to interesting websites, use footnotes -- but trust your reader to know how to use a web search engine.

% Your text reads nicer if you do not use citations as a substitute for nouns (like this section did).
% Instead of \emph{The benefits of cement filled tires has been shown by \cite{akyildiz2002survey}}, consider writing \emph{\textcite{akyildiz2002survey} have shown the benefits of cement filled tires}.
% The \texttt{textcite} command makes this straightforward.

% Make sure to read your bibliography section (that is, the typeset list of references) after you are done adding all citations to your text.
% Does it contain all information needed to uniquely identify to references you used?
% Do not trust BibTeX files you find on the web:
% Digital libraries frequently have their contents wrong, are missing information, or are using different field names than your bibliography style expects (leading to missing information in the typeset bibliography).
% To give a few examples:
% Check the authors' list (making sure all authors are listed in the same order and in the same way they are listed in the publication).
% Check the conference location (it's most likely not ``New York, New York'').
% Check the publisher name (many digital libraries use a field that is not typeset by your bibliography style; have a look at the demo bibliography in this template for how to deal with that).
% Check the page numbers (many digital libraries put ``1--5'' here despite the paper starting at a later page -- or despite it not having any page numbers to begin with).
Check the conference name, put its parts in a logical order, and lose the ``in proceedings of'' (it's not ``Mobicom, in proceedings of, 1999 series MobiCom99'' but ``5th ACM International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking (MobiCom 1999)''.\todo{triple-check all references}
