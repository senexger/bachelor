\chapter{Evaluation}
\begin{itemize}
\item measurement setup / results / evaluation / discussion
\item whatever you have done, you must comment it, compare it to other systems, evaluate it
\item usually, adequate graphs help to show the benefits of your approach
\item each result/graph must not only be described, but also discussed (What's the reason for this peak? Why have you observed this effect? What does this tell about your architecture/system/implementation?)
\item recommended length: approximately one third of the thesis.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Keep in Mind}
\begin{itemize}
\item metrics (SR, Latency, ...)
\item compare with art-net all the time
\end{itemize}

\section{Methodic}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Testbed
	\item Collect Data
	\item Seqence Diagram to explain 
\end{itemize}

\section{Protocols under Study}
\begin{itemize}
	\item 
\end{itemize}
\subsection*{Unicast vs Broadcast}
\subsection*{Rapid Repetition}
\subsection*{Delayed Repetition}
\subsection*{Grouping}

\section{Results}
\TODO{Difference between Results and Discussion?}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Grafen miteinander verlgeichen?
	\item Which method had the best results?
\end{itemize}

\chapter{Conclusion \& Discussion}
\begin{itemize}
\item summarize again what your paper did, but now emphasize more the results, and comparisons
\item write conclusions that can be drawn from the results found and the discussion presented in the paper
\item future work (be very brief, explain what, but not much how, do not speculate about results or impact)
\item recommended length: one page.
\end{itemize}

Why not 5GHz -> to expensive.\\
